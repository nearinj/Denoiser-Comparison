### Run_get_asv_match.sh
Runs get_asv_match.py on each pipeline data set at each filter stringency
### add_organism.py
Takes in a biom table in TSV format as well as the matchs table generated by get_asv_match.py and adds a column to the TSV table with any sequence that matched an organism.
### collapse_table.py
Takes in a table produced by add_oranism.py and generates a table that is collapsed by matchs to organisms with any that did not match being labelled as Non_Reference. The -p option can be used to add another column which will show the percent abundance that organism makes up in the sample. 
### get_asv_match.py
Takes in a blast file as well as the fasta file that was used to generate it and outputs a table that has the sequence ids as the first column and the organism it matched to at greater than 97% in the second column.
### run_add_organism.sh
Runs add_organism.sh on each pipeline data set at each filter stringency.
### run_collapse_table.sh
Runs run_collapse_table.sh on each pipeline data set at each filter stringency.

### All incl_db scripts are the same scripts as above but blasts the results against the SILVA/UNITE database. This script was used to create the Fungi ASV abundances due to the incomplete nature of the Fungi (mock-9) expected dataset.
